                Lab 2
            </h1>
            <p>
                I looked back at feedback concerning my lab 2 and went ahead in adding in structural/semantic elements that I was missing before.

            <h1>
                Lab 3
            </h1>
            <p>
                After completing lab 3, the website is a whole lot more colorful with blocks everywhere. In future versions I would like to make a fully working navigation bar for when we got to multi-page website development, as well as the implementation of graphics and images.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="section3">
            <h1>
                Lab 5
            </h1>
            <p>
                Its been a while since I've visited lab 3. After completing lab 5, I have managed to get a navigation bar (list) and am capable of adding images as done in the previous lab. I have also changed the color in consideration of good color contrast design as well as implemented a media query in adjusting the webpage's content based on the device's resolution.
