        <p>
            This course flew by really fast. Its crazy to 
            see all of what I've worked with culminate
            into one final project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several problems were encountered in this
            project which were primarily me modifying
            my past labs prior to integrating it like
            in the Labs section of this portfolio.
            Another challenge was getting the Rickbot
            to work. Making sure the ratio for each 
            device was also a challenge to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
            To overcome these issues I had to revisit
            my old labs and utilize my resources (ChatGPT,
            w3schools.com, programming forums, the course 
            materials, etc.)
            to help develop and visualize the appropriate
            code to my desired effect, just as I have for 
            most of my labs. A whole lot of back tracking
            and testing was necessary. Being resourceful and knowing
            how to push your learning to new limits comes
            a long way and is a lesson I will take to heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking this course as a whole, I am very much
            thankful for the experience as everything I've
            worked with can be applied in my life, should
            it be creating a website, applying
            the practices I have learned and used during
            the lab solving process, or by including my work
            in something like a real portfolio, 
            perhaps in job hunting or whatever else comes up.
