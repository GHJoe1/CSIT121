        <p>
            Geolocation API is a service that allows a user to share their
            geographic location with a website application. It is featured
            in a plethora of app processes such as navigation, e-commerce,
            and targeted advertising, with the list continuing on.
            An example of website apps using geolocation API include Google Maps,
            Uber, DoorDash, and Facebook.
            The W3C issued its first version to standardize the interface in
            December 22, 2008.
