            Both geolocation API and understanding it are important for many reasons.
            For one, it is a powerful tool. And as the saying goes, 
            "With great power comes great responsibility", so does the need in
            making sure that the use of such a tool is being used in a fair and
            efficient manner. Concerns such as privacy and that the information being
            relayed is reliable are key in maintaining website user retention and trust.
            Another reason is the fact that the use of geolocation has become incredibly
            widespread, with many of the processes potentially occuring without the users' awareness
            and even consent.
